semver.tools
============

Library to create and parse semantic versions and semantic version ranges, to check if a version is part of a range, etc. Also supports NuGet style versions and ranges.

Full documentation is at http://mperdeck.github.io/semver.tools

The initial version of this library is based on code lifted from https://github.com/Haacked/NuGet/tree/master/src
It was refactored to improve code organisation and reduce duplication, and documentation was added.
